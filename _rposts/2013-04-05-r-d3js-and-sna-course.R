#' Update 2015-11-09: This is migration from an old post.
#' 
#' I took the [SNA course](https://www.coursera.org/course/sna) by [Lada Adamic](http://www.ladamic.com/) in coursera. 
#' It's a super interesting course. In fact, I was using the networks only how a visualization tool, and that is 
#' what it make me little bit embarrassing because there are more, a lot of more. You can detect communities, know 
#' more centric nodes and a lot of other information. So, there are a lot of reasons to look the course
#' 
#' By other hand I like the d3 javascript library. Recently I was learning javascript, so I decided make a very 
#' little app to keep learning this library and show differents measures of centrality for each node in a set 
#' of 4 toy networks and see these measures by size, color or a label

##### Load Packages ####
library("sna") 
# for build a block diagonal matrix
library("Matrix")   
# (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-June/133875.html)
library("reldist")  
library("plyr")
library("rjson")

##### Functions ####
degree_sna <- function(net, norm = TRUE, ...){
  degree(net, ...)/2/(if (norm) ncol(net) - 1 else 1)
}

betweenness_sna <- function(net, norm = FALSE, ...){
  n <- ncol(net)
  betweenness(net, ...)/2/(if (norm) (n - 1)*(n - 2)/2 else 1)
}

##### Networks ####

#### Indicators ####
# Degrees for each node of each network
llply(nets, degree_sna)

# Differences beetween degree for nodes in each network
laply(nets, function(net){ gini(degree_sna(net)) })

# Centralization coefficient $C_D$
laply(nets, centralization, degree)

# Betweenness
llply(nets, betweenness_sna)
llply(nets, betweenness_sna, norm = TRUE)


# Closeness
llply(nets, closeness)

# Eigenvector Centrality
llply(nets, evcent)


#### Consolidate Data ####
names <- paste(rep(1:length(nets), laply(nets, ncol)),
               unlist(llply(nets, function(x) 1:ncol(x))), sep = "_")

#### Exporting Data ####
nodes_json <- adply(nodes, 1, toJSON )$V1
