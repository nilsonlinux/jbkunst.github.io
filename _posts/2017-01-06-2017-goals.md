1. Participate in a lot of projects.
1. See [data-science-chile](https://data-science-chile.github.io/) with a lot of people
  posting and sharing knowledge. 
1. Idem for [r-latinoamerica](https://r-latinoamerica.github.io/).
1. Put [erre](https://github.com/R-latinoamerica/erre) package to CRAN and see what happens.
1. Keep improving.
