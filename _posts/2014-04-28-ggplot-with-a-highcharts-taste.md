Update 2015-11-07: This is modification from an old post. Finnaly I made a pull request and was accepted by [Jeffrey Arnold](https://github.com/jrnold)

At work I use ggplot2 almost for everything. I really like the mid term between high level (highcharts) and low-level (like d3 for example). 
The deafult theme for ggplot it's good, and really good if you compare with the old looking R base graphics, and there is 
more: the [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes) package which have some themes for ggplot objects. However, I miss 
the elegant and modern touch, for example in [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/column-basic/).

So I decide to play around the <strong>theme</strong> function to replicate the look and feel of highcharts. The main tasks were:

* Change the font to a more modern one.
* Remove grid lines (minor ones).
* Use a more plain color palette.
* Reduce bar's width.
* Put a white background.
* Put the lenged at bottom.

The chosen font was [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) (an ultra used font nowadays) which you can use in R 
with [showtext](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/showtext/index.html) package.


```r
library("showtext")
library("ggplot2")

font.add.google("Open Sans", "myfont")
showtext.auto()

data(diamonds)

data <- subset(diamonds, color %in% c("E", "F", "G") & cut %in% c("Ideal", "Premium", "Good"))

data$indicator <- ifelse(data$color %in% c("G" ), 1, 0)

colors_hc <- c("#7CB5EC", "#313131", "#F7A35C",
               "#90EE7E", "#7798BF", "#AAEEEE",
               "#FF0066", "#EEAAEE", "#55BF3B",
               "#DF5353", "#7798BF", "#AAEEEE")


theme_hc <- function(){
  theme(
    text                = element_text(family = "myfont", size = 12),
    title               = element_text(hjust = 0), 
    axis.title.x        = element_text(hjust = .5),
    axis.title.y        = element_text(hjust = .5),
    panel.grid.major.y  = element_line(color = 'gray', size = .3),
    panel.grid.minor.y  = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x  = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x  = element_blank(),
    panel.border        = element_blank(),
    panel.background    = element_blank(),
    legend.position     = "bottom",
    legend.title        = element_blank()
  )
}
```

The theme is ready. Now to plot.


```r
ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(cut), width = .4, fill = colors_hc[1]) +
  ggtitle("An interesting title for a bar plot") +
  xlab("Cut") + ylab("Amount") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_hc()
```

<img src="/images/ggplot-with-a-highcharts-taste/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As you can see, the plot look more clean without the gridlines and the background. This cause less confusion (and maybe less detail) 
because generate more space.


```r
ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(color, fill = cut), position = "dodge", width = .4) +
  ggtitle("Another interesting title") +
  xlab("Cut") + ylab("Amount") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_hc) +
  theme_hc()
```

<img src="/images/ggplot-with-a-highcharts-taste/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Finally,


```r
ggplot(data) +
  geom_density(aes(x, fill = cut, color = cut), alpha = I(0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Density plot") +  xlab("x") + ylab("Density") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_hc) +
  xlim(4, 8) +
  theme_hc()
```

<img src="/images/ggplot-with-a-highcharts-taste/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In my humble option, it look great. What do you think?
